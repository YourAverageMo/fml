# Task 027: Publish `fml` Package to PyPI

**Priority:** High

**Description:**
Publish the `fml` Python package to PyPI using `uv publish` so users can install it via `uv tool install`. This involves building the package and then uploading the distribution files.

**Dependencies:**

- None (assuming `pyproject.toml` is correctly configured)

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Ensure `pyproject.toml` is configured:**
    *   Verify `[build-system]` is set to use `hatchling`.
    *   Verify `[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]` and `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` exclude `tests/**`.
    *   Verify `[tool.uv]` includes `package = true` and `no-sources = true`.
    *   Ensure `version` and `description` in `[project]` are accurate.

2.  **Publish the package:**
    *   Use `uv publish`. This command will automatically build the package if it hasn't been built already.
    *   Authentication: You will need to provide a PyPI token. It is recommended to set this as an environment variable: `export UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN="your_pypi_token_here"`. Alternatively, you can pass it directly with `--token`.

    ```bash
    uv publish
    ```

3.  **Verify installation:**
    *   After successful publication, verify that the package can be installed and imported correctly using `uv run`. The `--no-project` flag ensures `uv` does not install from the local project directory, simulating a fresh install from PyPI.

    ```bash
    uv run --with fml --no-project -- python -c "import fml"
    ```

**Test Strategy:**
1.  Confirm `uv publish` completes successfully without errors.
2.  Run the `uv run --with fml --no-project -- python -c "import fml"` command and ensure it executes without import errors.
