# Task 005: Clipboard Integration

**Priority:** Medium

**Description:**
Implement the functionality to automatically copy the generated CLI command to the user's system clipboard. A confirmation message will be displayed to the user after the command is successfully copied.

**Dependencies:**
- Task 004

**Implementation Details:**
- Install the `pyperclip` library (`pip install pyperclip` or `uv add pyperclip`).
- Implement a function or method to take the generated command string and copy it to the clipboard using `pyperclip.copy()`.
- After successful copying, display a confirmation message to the terminal, such as "(command copied to clipboard)".
- Consider potential cross-platform dependencies for `pyperclip` (e.g., `xclip`/`xsel` on Linux) and document them if necessary.

**Test Strategy:**
- Run the application with a test query that generates a command.
- After the output is displayed, verify that the command is present in the system clipboard by attempting to paste it into another application (e.g., a text editor or another terminal).
- Verify the confirmation message is displayed.
