# Task 008: Setup Testing Environment

**Priority:** High

**Description:**
Install `pytest` and configure the project to support testing. This includes creating a `tests/` directory and initial test files.

**Dependencies:**
- None

**Implementation Details:**
- Install `pytest` (`uv add pytest`).
- Create a `tests/` directory at the project root.
- Create an empty `tests/__init__.py` file to make it a Python package.
- Create a basic `tests/test_fml.py` file with a placeholder test to confirm the setup.
- Add `pytest` to `pyproject.toml` as a development dependency.

**Test Strategy:**
- Run `uv run pytest` (or `pytest` if installed globally) from the project root and ensure tests are discovered and run successfully (even if the placeholder test fails initially).
