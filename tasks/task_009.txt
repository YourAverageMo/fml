# Task 009: Test CLI Parsing

**Priority:** High

**Description:**
Write unit tests for the command-line argument parsing logic in `fml.py` to ensure correct handling of user queries and the display of helpful usage messages when no query is provided.

**Dependencies:**
- Task 008

**Implementation Details:**
- In `tests/test_fml.py`, write test cases for `fml.py`'s argument parsing.
- Use `unittest.mock.patch` or `pytest`'s `capsys` fixture to capture `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` to verify printed output (e.g., help messages).
- Test cases should cover:
    - Successful parsing of a query string.
    - Display of the help message when no query is provided.
    - Correct exit code when no query is provided.
    - Handling of queries with spaces and special characters.

**Test Strategy:**
- Run `uv run pytest tests/test_fml.py` to execute the tests.
- Verify all test cases pass, confirming the CLI parsing behaves as expected.
