# Task 007: Cross-Platform Testing

**Priority:** Low

**Description:**
Perform comprehensive testing of the `fml` application across different operating systems (macOS, Windows, and Linux) to ensure all core features function correctly and consistently.

**Dependencies:**
- Task 005
- Task 006

**Implementation Details:**
- Set up test environments for macOS, Windows, and a common Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
- Execute the application with a variety of test queries on each platform.
- Verify the following on each platform:
    - CLI argument parsing works correctly.
    - API key management functions as expected.
    - Gemini API integration successfully retrieves responses.
    - Response parsing and terminal display are accurate and readable.
    - Clipboard integration successfully copies the command.
    - Error handling messages are displayed correctly for various scenarios.
- Document any platform-specific issues encountered and propose solutions (e.g., `pyperclip` dependencies on Linux).

**Test Strategy:**
- Manual testing on each target operating system.
- Use a checklist of features to verify for each platform.
- Record any discrepancies or bugs found, along with system details.
