# Active Context: `fml` - AI-Powered CLI Command Helper

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current focus is on implementing tests for the `fml` project, starting with planning out the testing tasks.

## 2. Recent Changes

- Initial memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created based on the `prd.md`.
- The Python project environment has been initialized using `uv init`.
- The main application entry point (`fml.py`) has been created with basic CLI argument parsing implemented (Task 001 completed).
- All MVP development tasks (Task 001-007) have been created and added to the task queue.
- The project changes have been committed and merged to `main`.
- A new branch `add/tests` has been created for testing efforts.

## 3. Next Steps

The immediate next steps involve:
- Planning out the testing tasks for the project.
- Creating individual task files for testing.
- Updating `progress.md` with the new testing tasks.
- Implementing tests for existing functionalities, starting with CLI parsing and API key management.

## 4. Active Decisions and Considerations

- **AI Output Structure:** Strict adherence to the defined JSON structure for AI responses is critical for reliable parsing. Robust error handling for malformed responses is a priority.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** All features, especially clipboard integration, must be tested and verified across macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Modularity:** Maintaining the separation of concerns (core logic vs. presentation, AI abstraction) from the outset to facilitate future enhancements.
- **Prompt Engineering:** The initial system prompt for Gemini will be crucial for consistent and accurate command generation. This will be an iterative process.

## 5. Important Patterns and Preferences

- **Environment Variables for API Keys:** `GEMINI_API_KEY` will be used for secure API key management.
- **Python Standard Libraries:** Prioritizing `argparse` for CLI parsing.
- **External Libraries:** `google-generativeai` and `pyperclip` are the primary external dependencies for MVP.

## 6. Learnings and Project Insights

- The project's success heavily relies on the AI's ability to consistently provide structured and accurate command information.
- Cross-platform compatibility, particularly for clipboard operations, requires careful attention to potential system-level dependencies.
- A clear, modular architecture will be key to future extensibility, especially for adding new AI providers or a TUI.
